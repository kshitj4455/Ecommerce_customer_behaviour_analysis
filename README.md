# ðŸ›’ E-Commerce 360Â° â€” Project Summary

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose
This repository delivers a full 360-degree analytical and modeling framework for an e-commerce platform, covering **customer journey, engagement, transactions, and post-purchase behavior** to generate actionable insights for business growth.

---

## ðŸš€ Project Scope
To analyze **customer behavior** from browsing to post-purchase activities and identify **key drivers of retention, revenue, and satisfaction**.  
The project leverages **10 core data tables** to perform segmentation, funnel analysis, product performance review, and churn prediction.

| **Product_Catalog_Master** | Product details & attributes |
| **User_Interactions_Clicks** | Page views & clickstream events |
| **Shopping_Cart_Activity** | Cart addition/removal events |
| **Order_Transaction_Master** | Completed transactions and payments |
| **Product_Reviews_Ratings** | Post-purchase ratings and reviews |

## ðŸ“Š Analytical Themes & Project Questions

The analysis is grouped into major analytical themes guiding model design and insight generation.

---

### **A. Customer Segmentation & Value (RFM & CLV)**  
**Goal:** Identify and retain high-value customers while understanding purchasing behaviors and churn risk.

- **RFM Segmentation:**  
  - Determine optimal thresholds for *Recency, Frequency, and Monetary* values to classify customers (e.g., *Champions, Loyal, At-Risk, Lost*).  
  - Compare purchase patterns, engagement, and revenue contribution.  

- **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV):**  
  - Model and predict CLV using transactional history, demographics, acquisition source, and first purchase category.  
  - Identify high CLV segments for retention or upsell campaigns.  

- **Churn Prediction:**  
  - Detect predictors of churn (e.g., no purchase in X months).  
  - Use features like order frequency, session recency, complaint frequency, and support activity to predict churn risk.

---

### **B. Conversion Funnel & Product Analysis**  
**Goal:** Understand user paths, bottlenecks, and product performance throughout the purchase funnel.

- **Conversion Funnel:**  
  Analyze movement through each stage â€” *Browse â†’ View Product â†’ Add to Cart â†’ Checkout â†’ Purchase* â€” and calculate conversion rates.  

- **Conversion Bottlenecks:**  
  Identify drop-off points (e.g., users who view but donâ€™t add to cart, or add to cart but donâ€™t checkout).  

- **Product Performance:**  
  Determine top-performing products by *revenue, margin, and repeat purchases*.  
  Correlate *ratings/reviews* with *returns and repurchase likelihood*.

---

### **C. Marketing & Engagement Analytics**  
**Goal:** Optimize marketing efforts and customer acquisition strategies.

- **Channel Attribution:** Identify which marketing channels produce the highest LTV customers.  
- **Campaign Effectiveness:** Measure conversion, ROI, and retention impact from campaigns.  
- **Exposure Impact:** Evaluate how ad impressions and email engagement relate to order frequency.

---

### **D. Post-Purchase & Support Experience**  
**Goal:** Measure and improve customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.

- Analyze the relationship between support ticket types, resolution time, and repeat purchase behavior.  
- Evaluate the financial and satisfaction impact of returns and refunds.  
- Track operational metrics (e.g., time to delivery, return rate, and refund cycle).
